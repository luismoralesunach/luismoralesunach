## Hi, I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹

#I am a full-stack front-end focused web developer - TEAM PERN STACK!
I am a determined and fully commited person when it comes to work while working. Obviously I value a good work-life balance. I enjoy creating web apps and seeing the progress of the projects. I feel most comfortable in the front-end but I am able to work in the backend if necessary. I value good practices and always try to incoporate good practices in every project I do. I am proactive AND have NO problem communicating or working in a team! :)


#Free time/Personal?
I really enjoy 
- Watching footballâš½.
- Collecting football jerseys ðŸ‘•
- Playing videogames ðŸŽ®
- Going for coffee â˜•
